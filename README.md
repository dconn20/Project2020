# Summary
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher for his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Andersonâ€™s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from three different species of Iris, they are: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and the length and the width of the petals, each in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
