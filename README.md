# Project2020


# Intro
This project is being undertaken as part of my final submission for the module 'Programming and Scripting' as part of my course ‘Higher Diploma in Computer Science with Data Analytics’. 
The purpose of this project is to investigate ‘The Iris Flower Data Set’ and prove my understanding of the data set. I intend to research the data set and write documentation to support my findings. I will write code and run scripts within Python that I will use to investigate it and then provide written support of my views and knowledge of the data set.



# Summary
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher for his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from three different species of Iris, they are: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and the length and the width of the petals, each in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.  Subsequently, the Irish data set has become one of the most widely used reference data set for classification and prediction studies, and more recently for machine learning approaches to clustering, classification and pattern recognition.
